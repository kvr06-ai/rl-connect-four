# Connect Four with RL Agent: Technical Design Document

## 1. Overview
The **Connect Four with RL Agent** is a web-based game where users play the classic Connect Four game against a bot powered by reinforcement learning (RL). The bot starts with basic or random moves and evolves into a skilled opponent as it learns from user interactions or background training. The goal is to create an engaging, interactive experience that showcases RL capabilities while providing a fun challenge for users.

### Key Features:
- Interactive Connect Four game with a user-friendly interface.
- RL-powered bot that improves its gameplay over time.
- Real-time feedback on game state, moves, and outcomes.
- Optional difficulty levels based on the bot’s training progress.
- Visualization of the bot’s learning progress (e.g., win rate over time).

## 2. High-Level Architecture
The application follows a client-server architecture with three main components:
- **Front-End**: A web interface to render the game board, handle user inputs, and display game states.
- **Back-End**: A server to manage game logic, maintain game state, and coordinate with the RL agent.
- **RL Service**: A separate service that runs the RL model and provides the bot’s moves.

## 3. Front-End Design
The front-end provides the user interface and communicates with the back-end to update the game state.
Key Components:
Game Board: A 6x7 grid representing the Connect Four board. Each cell can be empty or contain a token (user or bot).

User Input: Users click a column to drop their token. The front-end sends the move to the back-end and updates the UI.

Game State Display: Indicators for whose turn it is, the last move, and game outcomes (win, lose, draw).

Optional Features:
Undo move (if feasible).

Restart game.

Select difficulty level (e.g., beginner, intermediate, expert).

Technology Stack:
HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the UI.

JavaScript (React): For dynamic updates, state management, and handling interactions.

API Communication: Use fetch or Axios for HTTP requests to the back-end.

Data Flow:
User clicks a column to make a move.

Front-end sends a POST request to the back-end with the selected column.

Back-end processes the move and responds with the updated game state.

Front-end updates the UI to reflect the user’s move.

If it’s the bot’s turn, the back-end includes the bot’s move in the response, and the front-end updates accordingly.

## 4. Back-End Design
The back-end handles game logic, maintains the game state, and integrates with the RL service.
Key Responsibilities:
Game State Management: Track the board configuration, current player, and game outcome.

Move Validation: Ensure moves are legal (e.g., column isn’t full).

Win/Draw Detection: Check for four-in-a-row (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) or a full board (draw).

RL Integration: Query the RL service for the bot’s move when it’s the bot’s turn.

Technology Stack:
Framework: Flask or Django (Python).

API Endpoints:
POST /start: Initialize a new game.

POST /move: Process a user move, update the state, get the bot’s move (if applicable), and return the updated state.

GET /state: Retrieve the current game state (optional).

Game State Representation:
A 6x7 grid as a 2D list/array with:
0: Empty

1: User’s token

2: Bot’s token

Data Flow:
Receive a user move via a POST request from the front-end.

Validate the move and update the board.

Check for win/draw conditions.

If the game continues, send the current state to the RL service to get the bot’s move.

Process the bot’s move, update the state, and check for win/draw again.

Return the updated game state to the front-end.

## 5. RL Agent Design
The RL agent uses a reinforcement learning algorithm to improve its Connect Four strategy over time.
Key Components:
State Representation: The 6x7 board as a matrix with values for empty, user, or bot tokens.

Actions: Seven possible actions (one per column) to drop a token.

Reward Function:
+1 for winning.

-1 for losing.

0 for a draw.

Optional: Small negative rewards per move to encourage efficiency.

Learning Algorithm: Deep Q-Network (DQN) with experience replay.

Training Process: Train in the background via self-play or from user games, storing histories for learning.

Technology Stack:
Framework: TensorFlow or PyTorch for the RL model.

Model Architecture: A neural network taking the board state as input and outputting Q-values for each action.

Training Data: Store game histories (states, actions, rewards) in a database.

Training Options:
Background Training: Agent plays against itself or simulated opponents.

User-Driven Training: Learn from user games, using outcomes to refine the policy.

Experience Replay: Sample past experiences to train the model for stability.

RL Service:
A standalone service with an API endpoint (e.g., POST /get_move) that:
Receives the current game state.

Uses the latest RL model to select an action (column).

Returns the chosen action to the back-end.

## 6. Data Storage
A database stores game histories and model checkpoints for training and analytics.
Key Data:
Game Histories: Sequences of states, actions, and rewards per game.

Model Checkpoints: Save RL model weights periodically.

Technology Stack:
Database: MongoDB (flexible) or PostgreSQL (structured).

Storage: Cloud or local storage for model files.

## 7. User Experience Enhancements
Enhance engagement with:
Difficulty Levels: Offer RL models with varying training (e.g., beginner, expert).

Learning Progress: Show stats like win rate or average moves per game.

Game Feedback: Highlight moves, indicate turns, and announce outcomes.

## 8. Scalability and Security
Scalability: Use load balancers or a cloud platform (e.g., AWS) for multiple concurrent games.

Security: Protect against web vulnerabilities (e.g., input validation) despite no user authentication.

## 9. Testing
Game Logic: Validate rules, move legality, and win/draw detection.

RL Agent: Test learning and improvement via simulated games.

Front-End: Ensure UI responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility.

## 10. Deployment
Front-End: Host on a static service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).

Back-End: Deploy on a server (e.g., Heroku, AWS EC2).

RL Service: Run as a separate service or container (e.g., Docker).

## 11. Future Considerations
Add multiplayer mode for user-vs-user games.

Explore advanced RL methods (e.g., PPO, AlphaZero).

Introduce user accounts for tracking progress or leaderboards.
